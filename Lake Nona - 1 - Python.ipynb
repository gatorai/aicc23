    "* Analyze Python error messages and identify corrective action to fix them.\n",

    "* Discuss the importance of reusability and how libraries implement this concept.\n",
    "* Use import statements to access library functions.\n",

    "1. This file is a **Jupyter notebook**. It combines `text cells` and `code cells` and is useful as a hybrid didactic/experiential learning environment. In practice, Jupyter notebooks are often used for rapid code prototyping or communicating code and results in an understandable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Jupyter notebooks are *interactive*, and any code inside a code block is **executable**! Users will see the results of running code blocks directly inside the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There are 2 ways to execute a code cell:\n",
    "    1. Select (click) the cell, and click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button to the left of the cell to execute the code.\n",
    "    2. Select the cell, and press `Control + Enter` (on Mac, `Command + Enter`)\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. To add a new cell, click the `+ Code` or `+ Text` button in the tool bar at the top of the screen. (*Colab*)\n",
