    "### 🤔 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predicting surgical complications *before* surgery can inform (1) shared decisions regarding the appropriateness of procedures, (2) targeted risk-reduction strategies, and (3) postoperative resource use. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Cognitive and judgment errors are major sources of potentially preventable complications.\n",
    "    * Example: if the risk of complications is underestimated, high-risk patients may be triaged to general wards rather than more appropriate intensive care units (ICUs).\n",
    "    \n",
    "* AI-based clinical decision support has the potential to mitigate harm from cognitive errors occurring when estimating the risk of postoperative complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* All patients have a unique risk profile that is specific to their demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, physiological reserve, planned surgical procedure, and surgeon skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clinicians sometimes display moderate ability to estimate risk probabilities. AI tools are intended to augment decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many clinicians are hindered by time-consuming manual data entry requirements and lack of integration with clinical workflow.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* AI predictive models using automated EHR data inputs may be able to mitigate these challenges."

    "### 🔄 Lifecycle of ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Shown below are the major steps that are involved in a typical ML lifecycle.\n",
    "<img src=\"graphics/ML.png\" alt=\"ML lifecycle\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data extraction and processing\n",
    "* Relevant data must be extracted (example: all revelant laboratory values and vital signs).\n",
    "* Data quality and conformation to modeling requirements must be ensured through data preprocessing (example: fixing the missing data, removing any unwanted outliers, and encoding the categorical data.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Model development\n",
    "* Machine learning models are built from data.\n",
    "* Recall our module on functions: an ML model can be thought of as a **function** that maps a set of input values (example: patient characteristics) to an output value (example: probability of developing AKI).\n",
    "* We develop a model on data from a **training** cohort.\n",
    "* During the model refinement stage, known as **training**, model parameters (such as *weights* and *biases*) are altered to optimize the associations between inputs and outputs.\n",
    "* After training, a model is ready to make predictions on *new data it has not seen before*. But how accurate will it be?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Evaluation and Intepretation\n",
    "* Once a ML model is trained, we evaluate the end result on **testing** dataset to see how well the model performed or how reliable it is.\n",
    "* Multiple performance metrics such as accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity can be evaluated.\n",
    "* Once we are satisfied with a model's performance, we may implement **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to discover **why** a model behaves in a particular way.\n",
    "* XAI techniques include computing a relative importance score associated with each input feature/column (for a given patient, how important was each input in determining that patient's prediction?).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Deployment\n",
    "* ML model deployment is the process of placing a finished ML model into a live environment, such as creating a web service or mobile application for prediction.\n",
    "* It is imperative that the performance of an established model is continually monitored in prospective deployment to safeguard against data distribution shifts resulting from changes in populations, practice, or other changes that may result in deteriorating model performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Optimization\n",
    "* A deployed ML model has real-world impact and must be continuously monitored and maintained.\n",
    "* When new or updated data becomes available, or when we determine that an existing deployed model no longer results in satisfactory performance, we need to optimize the model by re-training and re-evaluating the ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will only focus on the first three phases. "

    "## ⚙️ Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we use our data to train a machine learning model, we must transform the raw data into **features** that an ML model can understand (sometimes these look quite similar, but not always). This critical step is called **data preprocessing**. Since real-world data can be messy, during this phase we also *clean* data to ensure the ML model can learn meaningful patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common data preprocessing steps may include the following (depending on the ML model used):\n",
    "* Removing outliers*\n",
    "* Addressing data missingess\n",
    "* Transforming binary string columns (e.g., sex) into a numerical form that the model can understand.\n",
    "* Transforming many-valued string columns (e.g., race) into a numerical form.\n",
    "* Normalizing input features to give them equal weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\*One common approach to remove outliers in ML projects is to remove observations that fall outside a specified range. In this tutorial, we remove observations whose values are less than the 1st percentile or greater than the 99th percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🕵️‍♂️ Addressing missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Missing data are common in routinely collected health data\n",
    "    * Many times, missingness can be informative (e.g. a particular test was not ordered because patient was healthy).\n",
    "    * In other cases, missingness may be at random or due to other factors (e.g., lack of routine follow-up)\n",
    "* Some models **require** filling in missing data with imputation methods. Others will gladly accept missing data. The decision of when, and how, to impute missing data is often dependent on the model, data, and problem. \n",
    "* In a Pandas DataFrame, missing values will be represented by `NaN` (*\"Not a Number\"*)\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple, but effective, imputation approach is to replace a patient's missing variable value with a value computed from all other patients. For example, if a patient is missing the `bmi` variable, we might impute the mean value for the `bmi` feature across all other patients. (Recall our Pandas module for other choices!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔍 Example:** Let's use code to replace any missing `bmi` values with the `median` bmi from all other patients. We can accomplish this using some Pandas functions we've already seen, along with the `df.fillna(x)` function, which for a given DataFrame `df`, replaces any missing values with the input value `x`."

    "## 🤖 Model 2: Artificial Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron)\n",
    "* An important part of an AI research project is evaluating different models to identify which works best for a given dataset and task.\n",
    "* Let's train a different machine learning model on the same dataset.\n",
    "* This time, we'll be using a deep learning (DL) model that uses an artificial neural network called the multi-layer perceptron (MLP).\n",
    "* We will be using the user-friendly Python library `Keras` to build our MLP model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Note:** A full description of DL or the MLP is beyond the scope of this lesson. We refer interested students to [Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., & Courville, A. (2016). Deep learning. MIT press](https://www.deeplearningbook.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Important bullet points for this module:\n",
    "* Deep learning was biologically inspired.\n",
    "* A DL model like the MLP is often defined in terms of **layers** (one *input layer*, one or more *hidden layers*, and one *output layer*). The more hidden layers that are added to a model, the \"deeper\" it gets.\n",
    "* Each hidden layer is designed to transform the data from the layer before.\n",
    "* The final layer learns to predict an outcome based on all of these transformations.\n",

    "Each hidden layer of our neural network will be created using the **Dense** class from Keras. For each layer, we must define the number of hidden units (also known as neurons). There are several optional arguments we may also pass, which can be viewed in the [Keras documentation page](https://keras.io/api/layers/core_layers/dense/). We can add many layers to our deep learning model using the .add() function of the Sequential class. You can think of a Sequential container as a list of hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first layer of our neural network, we must tell Keras how many variables to expect in each input vector. From our previous data exploration, we know that each patient is defined by 47 different variables, so the input dimension to our network is 47.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason why deep learning models are so powerful is their ability to model complex variable interactions through nonlinear activation functions. We have several choices for activation function. In our example, we will use the commonly chosen Rectified Linear Unit activation (ReLU).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are satisfied with the hidden layers of our model, we need to add an output layer for generating class predictions. Our output layer will also be a Dense layer, but it will only have a single (1) unit. Instead of ReLU, we will use a sigmoid activation function, which is typically chosen for binary classification problems such as ours. Using a sigmoid activation on our output layer allows us to interpret the output as a prediction probability. In other words, the probability that a given input vector belongs to class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined the architecture of our neural network, we will use the .compile() function to build it. In our example we are defining a few arguments that are associated with the training of our model:\n",
    "* We are using a binary cross-entropy loss. This is an appropriate choise for binary classification.\n",
    "* We will be using the Adam optimizer, which is a popular version of stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
